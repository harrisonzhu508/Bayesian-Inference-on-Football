# Bayesian-Football-Prediction

README to be perfected soon :) 

The data are head-to-head results of international matches between the World Cup 2018 teams. The models we use are Gaussian priors and

- Logistic Regression with logit link likelihood
- Poisson Regression with log link likelihood
- Poisson Regression with soft-ReLU link likelihood

Remark: In the presentation PDF where is says 'MSE' it should really be SE. I forgot to divide by the total number of observations - sorry!
